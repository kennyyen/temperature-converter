# Take home test for Peatix Front End Developer

## Instructions

Write a single page web application that takes the temperature in Celcius as input, converts it to Farenheit, and displays it as the ouput. It should also be able to take the temperature in Farenheit and output the equivalent temperature in Celcius. It should be a client side application with the main conversion logic running on the browser. 

# A few notes

- Feel free to use any application framework, markup format, or styling language, that you think demonstrate your skills. Please balance this decision with what you think are the most appropriate tools for the requirements.

- You are free to use any third party libraries that you think will help you implement the application. 

- It is up to you to decide on the design of the UI or add any additional features that you think will improve the user experience. 

- Please spend no more than 1 week in designing and implementing the solution, as it will be due after that. 

- You will be required to submit all the source code that you used to build the application. Please submit the folder containing all your source code as a single zip file. The folder should also contain all the necessary configuration and build scripts. If your framework or tool generates the raw JS and CSS files, there is no need to include those. Instead, please include the instructions on how to deploy or build your app in a README or README.md file. Please also omit all the package files, if you use any third party packages. The build tools or scripts should be able to download them automatically. 

- As hinted in the previous item, please include a README file to explain not only how to build the app, but also the solution that you used. Make sure to include the description on the rationale behind the UI design and the application architecture. It would also be good to explain how you came to the decision on which tools or framework to use. Please do not take this part lightly. It is a very important part of the solution, as written communication is an important part of remote work. 

- You will also be required to provide a URL to the page where the finished application is running. As this is a single page client side application, you can use any static host for this. We recommend that you use either GitHub Pages or Netlify as they allow you to host your app for free. However, it does not matter which service you use, as long as it allows us to interact with your finished application.

# Optional

If you have enough time remaining, please implement a way to toggle the application to run either in light or dark mode. Light mode is a UI where all the interface elements are predominantly light color, while dark mode has predominantly dark colors. The mechanism to switch from one mode to the other should be accessible during run time as opposed to being a build time switch. 

Please include the discussion for how you implemented the above requirement in the README file. As with the main solution, you should be able to explain the design and architectural decisions that led you to the final solution.
